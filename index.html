              <p>“User experience (UX) is a scientific, psychological, and problem-solving side of product, experience, and service design. It focuses on having a deep understanding of users, what they need, what motivations and habits they have as well as limitations. It also takes into account the business strategy and business objectives with the purpose of delivering an end-to-end solution” - Iwona Winiarska. Therefore, integrating UX with DevOps is essential for DevOps teams to ensure they solve the right problems and are understanding the user's real needs and desires. After the team receives the feedback, the new solution needs to be built and the whole cycle repeats until they get it right. As a result, a lot of time and money might be wasted as the delivery teams build the wrong thing or the user requirements change too many times ultimately reducing speed to market.</p>
              <p>A common challenge for many large organizations is that their development teams may struggle or delays a in the area of development due to proposals of the process of design, for this reason is important for UX designers to stay up to date on the latest trends and technologies in order to create the best user experiences. That is why is exposed below one of the latest trends in UX design is the use of artificial intelligence (AI). AI is a technology that is rapidly growing and evolving. The use of artificial intelligence can help to improve the user experience in technological projects. For example, AI can be used to design user interfaces that are more user-friendly and that adapt to the user's needs. In addition, AI can be used to improve the search engines on websites and to provide recommendations for products or services. All these benefits that data and artificial intelligence provide to all types of business have led us to think that only showing people what they are looking for at the perfect time is enough to generate impact, however, this is only the first step of a user. to be able to complete the task or objective of each technological product.</p>
              <p>Therefore, as Vishnuaravi affirm, designers is something that AI can never replace while design functions on the other hand, can be. As we can appreciate in the next examples that are AI tools helps in saving a lot of time and effort during each iteration:</p>  
              <p>Uizard and Airbnb’s AI are a popular platforms that teaches machines to understand graphical user interfaces recognizes standard hand drawn design and elements in the same way humans do. Using AI, one can generate native mobile applications directly from sketches. That is not all, apart from automating the design process, it also focuses on generating code from the sketch and test the flow with users. Exist another powerful tool that let designers automate design and export design right from platforms such as Sketch, Photoshop or Adobe XD. It also allows the designers to see specification prepared automatically and build interactive prototypes helping the designers create more efficient and effective workflows. Khroma uses AI to learn which colors you like and creates limitless palettes for you to discover, search, and save, use algorithms to learn and make decisions creating more personalized experiences for users understanding the user’s preferences.</p>
              <p>With these new tools, the development of continuous improvements goes in favor of the DevOps objective, offering a better product, each time in less time, of better quality and with greater certainty for its end customers. Finally, the design area is very important in the planning and continuous development stage in any framework such as DevOps, since it speeds up the launch of the product since it prevents errors with the Stakeholders, minimizing production time and therefore costs.</p>
              <p>In conclusion artificial intelligence has the potential to automate or semi-automate many of the tasks currently carried out by UX/UI designers. However, it is unlikely that AI will completely replace UX/UI designers in the near future. AI can help designers to automate tasks such as creating wireframes and prototypes, and can also help to identify user needs and preferences. However, human interaction and feedback will always be essential in the design process, and AI cannot completely replicate the creativity and intuition of a human designer because is not an easy task for a machine to understand human emotions which is very much necessary in designing. </p>
              <p>So, it is unlikely that AI would be taking all the jobs of designers, rather, it will be a designer’s new best friend — because when the machine automate the repetitive tasks, humans become creative and that is what needed to be a top designer.</p>
